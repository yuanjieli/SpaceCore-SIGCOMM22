### What is this figure about

This figure shows massive signalling procedures will delay all usersâ€™ services (initial/mobility registration and session establishment)  by queuing. We initiate procedures with varying number of users to evaluate 5G core(Open5GS) performance.
This motivates us to reduce the signaling latency in SpaceCore.

### Experimental Methodology

We use real LEO hardware to run a lightweight 5G core network, Open5GS, to illustrate the 5G core performance. Even for a lightweight core network, the signalling delay is high.

Here are the experiment details:

+ Hardware: (1) Raspberry Pi 4 used by Baoyun 5G LEO satellite and; (2)
Precision 7920 Workstation with Xeon E5-2630 (20 cores, 2.2GHz), which is  similar to (weaker than) Hewlett Packard Enterprise EL 8000s (24 cores, 2.4GHz) used by OrbitsEdge in satellites.
+ Software: [Open5GS](https://open5gs.org) and [UERANSIM](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM).
+ Reproduction steps:
	1. Deploy all functions of Open5GS on hardware 1/2, and deploy UERANSIM on any hardware (different from the hardware where Open5GS is located).
	2. Establish connections between Open5GS and UERANSIM. The tutorial is available in the [main README.md](../../README.md).
	3. Write scripts to insert users in batches and trigger registration signaling processes.
	4. Get signaling delay based on UERANSIM and Open5GS logs.
	5. Processing data, calculating the signaling delay of each procedure on two hardware.
